## Authentication System Changes

### Initial State
- Basic Replit OIDC authentication system
- Simple user session management
- Limited user data handling

### Temporary Bypass Implementation
During development, authentication was temporarily bypassed to enable testing:

**Backend Changes (`server/replitAuth.ts`):**
- `setupAuth()` function disabled
- `getSession()` middleware bypassed
- `isAuthenticated` middleware modified to inject mock user data
- Mock user: Ottmar Francisca (ottmar.francisca1969@gmail.com)

**Frontend Changes (`client/src/hooks/useAuth.ts`):**
- Always returned `isAuthenticated: true`
- Provided fallback mock user data

### Final State (Current)
- **Replit authentication fully restored**
- Original OIDC flow re-enabled
- Proper session management restored
- All security measures active
