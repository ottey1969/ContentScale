# ContentScale Project Issues Analysis

## Primary Issue: Authentication Disabled

**Location:** `/server/replitAuth.ts` lines 103-104

**Problem:** Authentication has been temporarily disabled for debugging purposes. The `isAuthenticated` middleware function contains:

```typescript
// TEMPORARY: Authentication disabled for debugging
return next();
```

This bypasses all authentication checks, causing the frontend to never receive user data from the `/api/auth/user` endpoint, which makes the `useAuth` hook always return `isAuthenticated: false`.

## Impact

1. **Frontend Routing:** The App.tsx router only shows the Landing page because `isAuthenticated` is always false
2. **Dashboard Access:** Users cannot access `/dashboard` or `/admin` routes
3. **API Endpoints:** While backend endpoints would work if called directly, the frontend never attempts to call them because it thinks the user is not authenticated

## Solution

Re-enable proper authentication by removing the temporary bypass and restoring the original authentication logic.

## Additional Issues Found

1. **Environment Variables:** The authentication system expects several environment variables that may not be properly configured in the Replit environment
2. **Session Storage:** Uses PostgreSQL for session storage which requires proper database configuration
3. **OIDC Configuration:** Relies on Replit's OIDC system which may have configuration issues

## Files to Modify

1. `/server/replitAuth.ts` - Remove authentication bypass
2. Potentially environment configuration in Replit
