- Lists subscribers: contact@weboom.be, info@smithersofstamford.com, ottmar.francisca1969@gmail.com
- Navigation seems to work but functionality needs testing

### 2. Credits Section:
- Credit Management interface is present
- Has form fields: User Email, Credits to Give, Reason (Optional)
- "Give 10 Credits" button is visible
- Instructions show: Enter user email, specify credits (1-1000), credits added to balance, user must have logged in once
- Functionality needs testing

### 3. Chat Section:
- Shows "Send Message to User by Email" with "Show Email Composer" button

- Lists 2 active conversations:
  - contact@weboom.be: "Nu net gedaan. 20 credits...."
  - ottmar.francisca1969@gmail.com: "Hi Joseph, het lukt niet met de credits...." (with red notification badge "2")
- Current chat system appears to be email-based, not real-time

### 4. Video Save Button:

## Next Steps:
1. Test Credits functionality
